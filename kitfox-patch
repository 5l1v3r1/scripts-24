# kitfox: make a customized Firefox.
# Unpack browser/omni.ja, apply patches, then package it back up.
# For more details on the process, see:
#  http://shallowsky.com/blog/tech/web/modifying-omni.ja.html

# Either run this from the downloaded and unpacked Firefox directory,
# or pass the path to that directory as the first argument.

# On a system where firefox is installed as a package, pass it the
# location of the firefox files, e.g. /usr/lib/firefox on Debian/Ubuntu.

# You'll need to re-run this every time Firefox updates browser/omni.ja.
# That doesn't necessarily happen in every Firefox update, but if
# you include a harmless patch to the default URLbar message,
# you can tell when it changes, which will tell you when you need
# to re-run the script. (See "silly message" below.)

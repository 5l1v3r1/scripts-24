This is the beginning of documentation on how to run my motion
detection camera system, which I use for taking wildlife photos.

<p>
For background, a quick-and-dirty enclosure, and sample images, you
can read my blog articles:
<a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/hardware/raspberry-pi-motion-camera.html">A
Raspberry Pi motion-detecting wildlife camera: Part 1</a>
and
<a href="http://shallowsky.com/blog/hardware/pi-motion-camera-2.html">A
Raspberry Pi motion-detecting wildlife camera: Part 2</a>.

<p>
In short, the system can drive three types of cameras: the Raspberry Pi
camera module, a standard USB webcam (as long as it's supported by the
Linux video driver and fswebcam), or an external camera that's
<a href="http://www.gphoto.org/doc/remote/">supported by gphoto2</a>.

<p>
If you wish, you can use two different cameras at once, a low-res
camera for taking the constantly repeating snaps to see if anything
has changed, and a high-res camera for taking photos once a change has
been noticed.

<p>
You can specify the sensitivity and threshold for deciding when a
change has happened, the test region of interest (only motion inside
this rectangle will be detected), a crop rectangle for the
high-resolution photos, a remotely mounted directory to save the
images (so you don't have to wear out your Pi's SD card), and a
local directory to save images if the connection fails to the remote directory.
Run <code>motion-detect.py --help</code> for more details.

<h3>Setting up the camera</h3>
The steps for setting up the camera in a new location:
<ol>
<li>Position the camera approximately and plug it in
<li>Go inside, wait a while then ssh to the pi. (This assumes you've
    configured the pi to use a fixed IP address.)
<li>Mount your remote filesystem on the pi:
     <code>sudo sshfs host:/path/to ~/localpath</code>.
<li>On the pi, take a test photo to the ssh-mounted directory:
     <code>raspistill -w 320 -h 240 -o ~pi/localpath/test.jpg</code>
<li>View the test photo on your desktop and make sure it includes the
    area you want to cover.
<li>If you're using a separate gphoto camera for the high-res shots,
    set it up and turn it on. Then, on the pi, check to make sure the
    image will be correct. cd into the shared directory (gphoto's capture
    will fail if the current working directory isn't the same as the
    one you're capturing to). This is the command the motion camera
    will use to capture high-res photos:
<pre>
# gphoto2 --set-config syncdatetime=1 --set-config --set-config capturetarget=sdram --capture-image-and-download --filename canon.jpg
</pre>
If you need to set a zoom level or other configuration parameters,
you can test that before starting the motion camera by running manual
gphoto2 commands, such as:
<pre>
# gphoto2 --set-config syncdatetime=1 --set-config zoom=5 --set-config capturetarget=sdram --capture-image-and-download --filename canon5.jpg
</pre>
Then make sure the changes stick by testing with the base command again:
<pre>
# gphoto2 --set-config syncdatetime=1 --set-config --set-config capturetarget=sdram --capture-image-and-download --filename canon.jpg
</pre>

<li>On the desktop, open the test photo in gimp (or any image editor
    you prefer) and measure the X, Y, width, and height of the test
    region you want to use, and the crop region if it's different.
    In gimp I made a selection with  the rectangular selection tool,
    then looked at the numbers reported in the Tool Options area of
    the Toolbox.
<li>On the Pi, su to root and run the motion detection script with
    whatever arguments you want: for instance,
    <br><code>python ./motion_detect.py -v -s 250 -t 30 -r 320x240 -b 150x125+100+100 -c - /tmp ~pi/moontrade/snapshots/ > ~/localpath/picam.out 2>&1</code>
    <br>-- redirecting the output to a file on the shared filesystem
    so you'll be able to follow it even if you close your initial
    ssh session.
</ol>

<p>
How do you determine what to pass in as sensitivity and threshold?
Remember, sensitivity is how many pixels must change; threshold is
how much each pixel must change. And unfortunately I don't have a good
answer to that. A threshold of 30 seems to be working pretty well
in my tests, but I haven't experimented much.
Sensitivity depends on the size of your test region, but it also
depends on how much the light conditions are changing -- do you have
scattered clouds sometimes covering the sun, or plants waving around
that might be generating shadows that change? My best advice is to
take a guess at some initial arguments, or run it with the defaults,
with verbose mode (-v) on, and see how much change you typically get
from one image to the next.

<h3>Watching the output</h3>
<p>
Okay, now the camera is running. You can monitor it by watching the output
window. If you see a line like
<pre>
===================== 1432 pixels changed
</pre>
that means it detected something and will snap a high-res image.
<p>
Or you can periodically ls the ssh-mounted directory. You'll see a
debug.png which shows you the latest image with the test region
and any changed pixels highlighted, a file with a name like
first-2014-05-18-09-09-24.jpg which is a high-res snapshot taken
at the beginning of the run. Any subsequent motion-induced photos
will be named something like snap-2014-05-18-09-22-57.jpg
(snap instead of first).
<p>
Happy snapping!
